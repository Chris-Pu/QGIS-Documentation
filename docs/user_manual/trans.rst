Translation test
================

This is just a file to test Transifex translations: https://www.transifex.com/qgis/qgisdoc/

Two sentences.

Some styling tests: a **bold** item, and *italic* item and a 
``fixed-space literal``. See what this looks like in github/lab.
Or what about combinations of those: **``fixed bold``** or 
*``fixed italic``* ?
