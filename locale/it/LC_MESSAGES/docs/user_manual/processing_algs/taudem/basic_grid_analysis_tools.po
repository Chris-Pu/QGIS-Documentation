"Identifies all pits in the DEM and raises their elevation to the level of "

"routing of flow across DEMs, so are removed by raising their elevation to "
"the point where they drain off the edge of the domain. The pour point is the"
" lowest point on the boundary of the \"watershed\" draining to the pit. This"
" step is not essential if you have reason to believe that the pits in your "
"DEM are real. If a few pits actually exist and so should not be removed, "

"removed, the actual pits should have NODATA elevation values inserted at "
