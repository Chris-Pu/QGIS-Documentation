"GRASS integration provides access to GRASS GIS databases and functionalities"
" (see GRASS-PROJECT in :ref:`literature_and_web`). The integration consists "
"of two parts: provider and plugin. The provider allows to browse, manage and"
" visualize GRASS raster and vector layers. The plugin can be used to create "
"new GRASS locations and mapsets, change GRASS region, create and edit vector"
" layers and analyze GRASS 2-D and 3-D data with more than 400 GRASS modules."
" In this section, we'll introduce the provider and plugin functionalities "
"and give some examples of managing and working with GRASS data."
msgstr "L'integrazione di GRASS fornisce l'accesso ai database e alle funzionalità di GRASS GIS (vedi GRASS-PROJECT in :ref:`literature_and_web`). L'integrazione consiste di due parti: sorgente e plugin. Il sorgente consente di sfogliare, gestire e visualizzare i layer raster e vettoriali GRASS. Il plugin può essere utilizzato per creare nuove posizioni e gruppi di GRASS, modificare la regione di GRASS, creare e modificare i livelli vettoriali e analizzare i dati GRASS 2D e 3D con più di 400 moduli GRASS. In questa sezione, introdurremo le funzionalità del sorgente e del plug-in e forniremo alcuni esempi di gestione e utilizzo dei dati GRASS."

"GRASS data are stored in a directory referred to as GISDBASE. This "

":file:`LOCATIONs`. Each :file:`LOCATION` is defined by its coordinate "

"or as workspaces for individual team members (see Neteler & Mitasova 2008 in"

"with GRASS modules, you generally have to import them into a GRASS "
":file:`LOCATION`. (This is not strictly true -- with the GRASS modules "
":file:`r.external` and :file:`v.external` you can create read-only links to "

Questa cartella, spesso chiamata :file:`grassdata`, deve essere creata prima di iniziare a lavorare con il plugin GRASS in QGIS.

Ogni :file:`LOCATION` è definito dal suo sistema di coordinate, dalla proiezione e dai confini geografici. Ciascun :file:`LOCATION` può avere diversi :file:`MAPSET`  (sottocartella di :file:`LOCATION`) che vengono utilizzati per suddividere il progetto in diversi argomenti o sottoregioni o come aree di lavoro per i singoli membri del team (vedere Neteler & Mitasova 2008 in: ref: `literature_and_web`). Per analizzare i vettori e i raster con i moduli GRASS, devi generalmente importarli in una :file:`LOCATION` GRASS. (Questo non è sempre vero - con i moduli GRASS :file:`r.external` e :file:` v.external` è possibile creare collegamenti di sola lettura a insieme di dati esterni supportati da GDAL/OGR senza importarli. Questo non è un modo perchi inizia  a lavorare con GRASS, quindi questa funzionalità non sarà descritta qui.) "
