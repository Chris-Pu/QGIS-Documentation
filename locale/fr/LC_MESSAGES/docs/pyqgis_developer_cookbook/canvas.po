"The Map canvas widget is probably the most important widget within QGIS "
"because it shows the map composed from overlaid map layers and allows "
"interaction with the map and layers. The canvas always shows a part of the "
"map defined by the current canvas extent. The interaction is done through "
"the use of **map tools**: there are tools for panning, zooming, identifying "
"layers, measuring, vector editing and others. Similar to other graphics "
"programs, there is always one tool active and the user can switch between "
"the available tools."
