"This section will help you set up an automatic report in QGIS. By definition"
" a GIS report is a document containing information organized in a narrative,"
" graphic, maps, or tabular form, prepared on ad hoc, periodic, recurring, "
"regular, or as required basis. Reports may refer to specific periods, "
"events, occurrences, or subjects, locations, and may be communicated or "
"presented in oral or written form. The reports in QGIS will allow the users "
"to output their GIS projects in a simple, quick and structured way."

"Cette section va vous aider à mettre en place une génération automatique de "
"rapports dans QGIS. Par définition, un rapport SIG est un document contenant"
" des informations organisées dans des formulaires narratifs, graphiques, "
"cartographiques ou tabulaires préparés selon les besoins ou pour sur une "
"base périodique, récurrente, régulière ou au cas par cas. Les rapports "
"peuvent se référer à des périodes spécifiques, des évènements, occurences ou"
" à des sujets, emplacements différents. Ils peuvent servir de supports de "
"communication écrits pour des publications ou des communications. Les "
"rapports dans QGIS permettent aux utilisateurs d'extraire le contenu des SIG"
" sous une forme simple et rapide."

"First, the report header, then a page for each state, and finally the report"

"make things more interesting by adding a subsection to our state group. We "
"do this by first selecting the state field group in the organizer, then "

"When a :guilabel:`Field Group Section` is iterating over its features, it "
"will automatically filter these features to match the feature attributes "

"over a :guilabel:`Populated Places` layer, including a body section for each"
" place encountered. The magic here is that the :guilabel:`Populated Places` "
"layer has an attribute named :guilabel:`adm1name`, tagging each place with "
"the state it’s contained within (if you’re lucky your data will already be "
"structured like this – if not, run the Processing :ref:`Join Attributes by "
"Location <qgisjoinattributesbylocation>` algorithm and create your own "
"field). When we export this report, QGIS will grab the first state from the "
":guilabel:`Admin Level 1` layer, and then iterate over all the "
":guilabel:`Populated Places` with a matching :guilabel:`adm1name` value. "

"Here we created a basic body for the Populated Places group, including a map"
" of the place and a table of some place attributes. So our report is now a "
"report header, a page for each state followed by a page for every populated "
"place within that state, and finally the report footer. If we were to add a "
"header for the Populated Places group, it would be included just before "
"listing the populated places for each state:"

"In addition to nested subsections, subsections in a report can also be "

"group` for :guilabel:`Airports`, then our report will first list ALL the "
