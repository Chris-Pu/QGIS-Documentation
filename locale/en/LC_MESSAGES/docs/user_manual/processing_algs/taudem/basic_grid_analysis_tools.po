"Identifies all pits in the DEM and raises their elevation to the level of"

"the routing of flow across DEMs, so are removed by raising their "
"elevation to the point where they drain off the edge of the domain. The "

"believe that the pits in your DEM are real. If a few pits actually exist "
"and so should not be removed, while at the same time others are believed "
"to be artifacts that need to be removed, the actual pits should have "
"NODATA elevation values inserted at their lowest point. NODATA values "
"serve to define edges in the domain, and elevations are only raised to "
"where flow is off an edge, so an internal NODATA value will stop a pit "
