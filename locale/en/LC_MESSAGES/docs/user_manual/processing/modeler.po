"The *graphical modeler* allows you to create complex models using a "
"simple and easy-to-use interface. When working with a GIS, most analysis "
"operations are not isolated, but rather part of a chain of operations "
"instead. Using the graphical modeler, that chain of processes can be "
"wrapped into a single process, so it is as more convenient to execute as "
"a single process later on a different set of inputs. No matter how many "
"steps and different algorithms it involves, a model is executed as a "
"single algorithm, thus saving time and effort, especially for larger "
"models."
