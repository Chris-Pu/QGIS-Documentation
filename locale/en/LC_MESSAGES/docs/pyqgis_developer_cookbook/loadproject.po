"is a singleton class, so you must use its :meth:`instance() "
"<qgis.core.QgsProject.instance>` method to do it. You can call its "
":meth:`read() <qgis.core.QgsProject.read>` method, passing the path of "
"the project to be loaded:"

"If you need to make modifications to the project (for example to add or "
