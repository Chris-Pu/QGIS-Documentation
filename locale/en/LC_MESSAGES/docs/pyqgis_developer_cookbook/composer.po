"There are generally two approaches when input data should be rendered as "

"Print layout is a very handy tool if you would like to do a more "

"possible to create complex map layouts consisting of map views, labels, "
"legend, tables and other elements that are usually present on paper maps."
" The layouts can be then exported to PDF, raster images or directly "
"printed on a printer."

"The layout consists of a bunch of classes. They all belong to the core "
"library. QGIS application has a convenient GUI for placement of the "
"elements, though it is not available in the GUI library. If you are not "

"<https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/graphicsview.html>`_, then you are encouraged to "
