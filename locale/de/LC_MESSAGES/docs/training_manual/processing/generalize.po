"Sometimes we need a simplified version of a vector, to have a smaller file "
"size and get rid of unnecessary details. Many tools do this in a very rough "
"way, and miss the adjacency and sometimes the topological correctness of "
"polygons. GRASS is the ideal tool for this: being a topological GIS, "
"adjacency and correctness are preserved even at very high simplification "
"levels. In our case, we have a vector resulting from a raster, thus showing "
"a \"saw\" pattern at borders. Applying a simplification results in straight "
"lines:"
