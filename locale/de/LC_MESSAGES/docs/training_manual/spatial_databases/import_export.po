"This is a known issue regarding the creation *in situ* of a spatial index "

"parameter. This will mean that no spatial index is being created directly, "
"and you'll need to create it in the database after the data have been "
"imported. (The creation of a spatial index will be covered in the next "
"lesson.)"
