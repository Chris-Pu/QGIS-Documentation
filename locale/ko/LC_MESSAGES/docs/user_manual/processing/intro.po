"This chapter introduces the QGIS processing framework, a geoprocessing "
"environment that can be used to call native and third-party algorithms from "
"QGIS, making your spatial analysis tasks more productive and easy to "
"accomplish."
msgstr "이 장에서는 QGIS 공간 처리 프레임워크를 소개합니다. QGIS 공간 처리 프레임워크는 QGIS에서 내장 및 제 3자 알고리즘을 호출하는 데 사용되는 지리 공간 처리 환경으로, 사용자가 공간 분석 업무를 더 생산적으로 더 쉽게 완수할 수 있도록 해줍니다."
