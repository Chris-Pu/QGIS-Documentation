"Vector data is arguably the most common kind of data you will find in the "
"daily use of GIS. The vector model represents the location and shape of "
"geographic features using points, lines and polygons (and for 3D data also "
"surfaces and volumes), while their other properties are included as "
"attributes (often presented as a table in QGIS). It is usually used to store"
" discrete features, like roads and city blocks. The objects in a vector "
