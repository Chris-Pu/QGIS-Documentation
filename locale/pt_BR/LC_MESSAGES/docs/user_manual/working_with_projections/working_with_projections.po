"QGIS has support for approximately 7,000 known CRSs. These standard CRSs are"
" based on those defined by the European Petroleum Search Group (EPSG) and "
"the Institut Geographique National de France (IGNF), and are made available "
"in QGIS through the underlying \"Proj\" projection library. Commonly, these "
"standard projections are identified through use of an authority:code "
"combination, where the authority is an organisation name such as \"EPSG\" or"
" \"IGNF\", and the code is a unique number associated with a specific CRS. "
"For instance, the common WGS 84 latitude/longitude CRS is known by the "
"identifier ``EPSG:4326``, and the web mapping standard CRS is ``EPSG:3857``."

"In order to correctly project data into a specific target CRS, either your "

"that PostGIS layer was created. For data supported by OGR or GDAL, QGIS "
"relies on the presence of a recognized means of specifying the CRS. For "
"instance, for the Shapefile format this is a file containing the Well-Known "
"Text (:index:`WKT`) representation of the layer's CRS. This projection file "
