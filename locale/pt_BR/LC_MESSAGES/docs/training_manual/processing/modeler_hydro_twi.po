"We have already created a few models, and in this lesson we are going to see"
" how we can combine them on a single bigger one. A model behaves like any "
"other algorithm, which means that you can add a model that you have already "
"created as part of another one that you create after that."

"In this case, we are going to expand our hydrological model, by adding the "
"mean TWI value in each of the basins that it generates as result. To do "
"that, we need to calculate the TWI, and to compute the statistics. Since we "
"have already created a model to calculate TWI from a DEM, it is a good idea "
"to reuse that model instead of adding the algorithms it contains "
"individually."
